# minimal-android-project

This repository shows how simple it is to set up a valid, working Android project. You will need:

* One `.java` source file, placed in its appropriate package directory
* One `AndroidManifest.xml`
* One `build.gradle`
  * certainly this is optional, as you can build the project using command line tools from the Android SDK. But
    let's not complicate things unnecessarily.

Suggestions on how to minimize this even further are welcome!
